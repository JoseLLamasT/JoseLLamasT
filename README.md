I am feeling a deep love for developing new technologies or goods focus on improve our life quality. Therefore,  I studied Mechanical Engineering, which I love. While I was studying I had the opportunity to support friends building 3D printers,   robots, mechanical arms, automatic fruit dehydrators and so on. However, I worked just on the mechanical system. Since that time I was wondering how a machine could do what we want by writing some lines of code, so I decided to take the next step and learn how to code as well.

Currently, I am a full stack developer,  able to work with JavaScript and many technologies related, including React, HTML and CSS, on the front-end and other such as Node.js (Express and Koa), SQL (MySql, PosgresSql), NoSql (MongoDB), sequalize, etc on back-end. Those knowledge allow me to built full-stack projects, increasing my abilities day by day.

In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking and any other outdoor sport, making a balance between my professional and personal life.
